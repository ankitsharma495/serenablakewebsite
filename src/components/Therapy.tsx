            Therapy can be a space where you invest in yourselfâ€”  one of the highest
            forms of self-care.

            You may be led to therapy by anxiety, depression, relationship stress,
            past or recent trauma, grief and loss, self-esteem issues, or challenges
            with family, parenting, or parental relationships. Whatever the source
            of your stress, you don&rsquo;t have to face it alone. Therapy offers you the
            time and space to work toward wellness and peace.
